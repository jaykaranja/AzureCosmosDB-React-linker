The code above contains all the main functionalities required to manage an Azure CosmosDB resource that can be run from a ReactJS application. All credit goes to the author of the code, and Microsoft.
For more information, simply visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/cosmos.

To start, perform:

npm install

All the functions are contained in the src/cosmos/Client.js where each line is well documented for you to implement accordingly. In case of any problem
 you run into, fix it. I am not liable of any wrong doing done by use of the function. Configure the structure of the Client.js file accordingly to avoid the code running in an unexpected manner before you run the start function.

 Once your files are organized, perform:

npm run dev
